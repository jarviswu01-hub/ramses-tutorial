## Abstract

Time-series data vary widely across domains, making a universal anomaly detector impractical. Methods that perform well on one dataset often fail to transfer because what counts as an anomaly is context dependent. 

The key challenge is to design a method that performs well in specific contexts while remaining adaptable across domains with varying data complexities.

We present the **RAMSeS framework** (Robust and Adaptive Model Selection for Time-Series Anomaly Detection). RAMSeS comprises two branches:

1. **Stacking ensemble** optimized with a genetic algorithm to leverage complementary detectors
2. **Adaptive model-selection branch** identifies the best single detector for the given context
